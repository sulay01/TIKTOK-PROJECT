# 🎯 TikTok Claims Classification Project

## 📌 Overview
The TikTok data team is working on a **machine learning model** to classify **claims in videos**. This project aims to **streamline the claims review process** by determining whether **statements made in videos** are **claims (fact-based) or opinions (subjective beliefs)**. By analyzing **engagement patterns and textual content**, this project will help **automate content moderation and improve classification accuracy**.

## 📊 Project Status
- ✅ **Project proposal approved**, allowing access to TikTok’s user data.
- ✅ **Initial data review and structuring completed**, focusing on relevant variables.
- ✅ **Identified key differences** between **claims vs. opinions** to guide feature engineering.
- 🚀 **Next phase**: Preparing dataset for **machine learning model training**.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1️⃣ **Claims vs. Opinions Classification** – Claims involve **unsourced or unverified statements**, while **opinions express subjective viewpoints**.  
2️⃣ **Data Organization** – Structured **dataset columns**, removed irrelevant variables, and **created meaningful new features** for classification.  
3️⃣ **Key Variables Identified** – Certain words, phrasing, and **engagement metrics correlate with claim vs. opinion classifications**, helping guide feature selection.  

## 🎯 Objective
- **Develop a dataset** for a **machine learning model** to **classify video content** as **claims or opinions**.  
- **Analyze engagement trends** to determine factors that influence classification.  
- **Enhance content moderation** using **AI-driven classification models** to reduce **manual review workload**.  

## 📊 Results
- 📌 **Cleaned and structured dataset**, focusing on key **text-based and engagement variables**.  
- 📌 **Minimum and maximum value analysis** conducted for selected variables.  
- 📌 **New feature engineering completed**, including word frequency analysis for **predictive modeling**.  
- 📌 **Irrelevant columns removed** to optimize **model performance** and data processing speed.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
✔ **Feature Engineering for Machine Learning** – Develop **text-based predictors** to distinguish claims from opinions.  
✔ **Train Initial Classification Model** – Apply **supervised learning algorithms** to assess model accuracy.  
✔ **Enhance Dataset with Additional Features** – Explore **context-based variables**, such as **source credibility or engagement trends**.  
✔ **Test and Validate Model Performance** – Use cross-validation to refine model accuracy.  
✔ **Deploy Model for Content Moderation** – Implement AI-powered automation to assist **TikTok’s content review teams**.  

## 📌 Conclusion
This project lays the foundation for **automated claims classification on TikTok**, improving **content moderation efficiency and accuracy**. By leveraging **machine learning and AI**, TikTok can **enhance user experience, reduce misinformation, and streamline claim verification processes**.
